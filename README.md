A Fibonacci sequence calculator with cache in javascript - Functional Programming

I found this solution after reading [The Magical World of Functional Programming: Part I: Thinking Functional](https://www.amazon.com/Magical-World-Functional-Programming-Thinking-ebook/dp/B00PYBJ7DQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1465961368&sr=8-1&keywords=the+magical+world+of+functional+programming),
which I totally recomend.

I hope this is really helpful for you.
